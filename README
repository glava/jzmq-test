###Motivation
I created small project, based on couple of articles, as a remainder how I solved issues with runing zeromq on osx.

###Prerequisite

1. JDK Instaled

###Instalation

		brew install zeromq
		brew install pkg-config

Make sure that your pkg.m4 can be found /usr/share/aclocal

		sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/aclocal/pkg.m4 /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4

Get java bindings at [jzmq github](https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq). In folder do
		
		./autogen.sh
		./configure
		make
		make install

This creates zmq.jar library that is located in /usr/local/share/java. In this simple project I added this library through
IDE

Make sure to send this VM arguments before runing the main

	-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib
